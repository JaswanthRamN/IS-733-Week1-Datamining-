# IS-733-Week1-Datamining
## Project Overview  

In **Week 1 of Data Mining Class**, I familiarized myself with **Jupyter Notebook** and basic **pandas** functions for data analysis. This assignment focuses on exploring the dataset **"DataAnalyst.csv"**, analyzing job trends, salaries, and ownership structures across industries.

### Key Steps in the Analysis:
- **Loaded the dataset** and checked its shape (number of rows and columns).
- **Explored the data** by displaying the top 5 rows.
- **Industry Analysis**: Created a **bar plot** of the **Top 5 industries by job count** (excluding `-1`).
- **Data Cleaning**: Performed various **cleaning operations** and documented them with comments for better understanding.
- **Salary Analysis**: Generated a **bar plot** of **mean salary estimates** for the top 5 industries.
- **Ownership Type Exploration**:
  - Investigated how **ownership types impact industries**.
  - Counted the occurrences of different **ownership types**, excluding missing values.
  - Identified the **top 3 most frequent ownership types** and visualized their distribution across the top 5 industries.

This analysis helped in **understanding job trends, salary estimates, and the impact of ownership types on industries**.
